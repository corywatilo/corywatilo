_Sounds like WADDLE-low_

I design interfaces and user experiences for web software. My wife and I live in an RV and travel fulltime. You can follow our adventures on Instagram at [@summerwithyouuu](https://www.instagram.com/summerwithyouuu/).

## Currently...

I'm Lead Designer at [PostHog](https://posthog.com "Link: https://posthog.com"), but you could also just call me the PostHog.com webmaster. When I have time, I'm also building [RV Envy](https://rvenvy.co). I also manage [Posthaven](https://posthaven.com) and [FolioHD](https://foliohd.com).

## Previously...

- Co-founder at [Brightback](https://brightback.com "Link: https://brightback.com")
- First designer at [Heap](https://heap.io)
- Co-founder at Preact (acquired by Spotify in 2016)

In the past, I've done quite a bit of consulting in the automotive space for companies like Kelley Blue Book (where I was fortunate enough to design the [KBhttps://watilo.foliohd.com/kelley-blue-bookrice Advisor](url) and Carvana. I also designed and built most of themes available for the blogging platform Posterous. (Posterous was acquired by Twitter in 2012 and Posthaven was birthed out of it.)
