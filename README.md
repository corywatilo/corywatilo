# Cory Watilo
_Sounds like WADDLE-low_

I design interfaces and user experiences for web software. Usually for startups. [You can find me on Instagram.](https://instagram.com/watilo)

## Currently...

I'm Lead Designer at [PostHog](https://posthog.com "Link: https://posthog.com"), but you could also just call me the PostHog.com webmaster. I do a little bit of everything – design, product thinking, copywriting, front end development, art directing, and building random weird memorable and fun things like [this](https://posthog.com/sales), [this](https://posthog.com/privacy), [this](https://posthog.com/dpa), [this](https://twitter.com/theo/status/1837227727189069999), and [this](https://posthog.com/careers).

When I have time, I'm also building [RV Envy](https://rvenvy.com) and [Posthaven](https://posthaven.com). I also continue to maintain my first side project I started with my first co-founder back in 2010 called [FolioHD](https://foliohd.com).

My milf and I lived in an RV and traveled fulltime from 2018-2021 until we decided to settle down in Tampa, Florida.

## Previously...

- Co-founder at [Brightback](https://brightback.com "Link: https://brightback.com") (acquired by Chargebee in 2020)
- First designer at [Heap](https://heap.io) (acquired by Contentsquare in 2023)
- Co-founder at Preact (acquired by Spotify in 2016)

In the past, I've done quite a bit of consulting in the automotive space for companies like Kelley Blue Book (where I was fortunate enough to design the [KBB Price Advisor](https://watilo.foliohd.com/kelley-blue-book)) and a bunch of stuff at Carvana. I also designed and built most of themes available for the blogging platform Posterous. (Posterous was acquired by Twitter in 2012 and Posthaven was birthed out of it.)

## Fun facts

- My primary mode of transportation is [a golf cart](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfmYzaZOlxL/)
- I always wanted to be an architect (until I discovered it would take 8 years of school), so now I'm an _information_ architect instead
- [My truck](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDT6xezFsoF) ~is~ was bigger than your truck
- I scored the license plate "[HASHTAG](https://www.instagram.com/p/5oGdUpk4fK/)" in California. When I went to pick it up, the DMV lady told me I would probably get pulled over because the cops would think it's a drug reference.
